- put the modules into their own directory

- added comments and organized the functions

- bot can receive any message now and will always return something back. 

- added a new module, checker.py, used for parsing and checking the user's
  message to ensure it is in the correct format.

- bot expects messages to be in the format: subreddit space # of posts space category
  - take a look in modules/checker.py for more details
  - try just texting like, "hello" or "nice" (assuming those subreddits don't exist) and see what happens

- the user can still text just a subreddit and get a top post, like how it was originally

- allows messages to be sent that exceed 1600 characters. Make sure you set the twilio config
  info to yours though, before trying a >1600 message request. Right now it is set to mine.

- decided to just ignore the whole "starting point" idea (remembering where the user was at if
  they request to see more posts). Maybe one day we can get back to it. Still left the code in the
  reddit function that deals with starting points, in case we ever end up using it. 
  lmk what you think though.

- I guess we're done, just need to buy a twilio account I suppose, lmk if we need to do anything else
