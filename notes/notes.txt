Notes for Project

Inbound/Outbound settings - url will be our web app address, like redditSMS.appspot.com
http responses will be like ?sent=true, ?phonenumber=xxxxxx, etc. ?subreddit=UCI

sms conversations can start once app is deployed with a web url


TODO

set up webhooks with twilio for conversations - https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
