Potential conversation:

Note: forgot to include this, but at the end of the every message the bot says, the bot should say
something like, "text 'bye' to end this conversation" and the upon the user saying that, the bot says,
"Thank you, have a nice day" or something.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- bot waits for a text from user

- bot receives a response

- bot says:
	Hello, what subreddit would like to search in today?
		- text "random" if you would like a random subreddit

- user says "UCI"

- bot says:
	Accessing UCI subreddit...
	From here, you can view posts, but what type of posts would you like to view, and how many?
	 - text "{number of posts} hot" to get a desired number of hot posts
	 - text "{number of posts} new" to get a desired number of new posts
	 - text "{number of posts} rising" to get a desired number of rising posts
	 - text "{number of posts} controversial" to get a desired number of controversial posts
	 - text "{number of posts} top" to get a desired number of top posts
	 - text "{number of posts} glided" to get a desired number of glided posts

- user says "2 hot"

- bot says:
	Here is the first post listed in the hot category on the UCI subreddit:
	{link of post}
	{title of post}
	{body of post}

	Here is the second post:
	{link of post}
	{title of post}
	{body of post}

	Would you like to do anything else?
		- text "move" to go to another subreddit
		- text "continue hot" to read more posts from this category
		- text "move category" to go to another category on this subreddit

if user says "move" here, 
	* bot returns to line 8, saying the same thing, without the "hello" at the beginning *

if user says "continue hot" here,
	- bot says:
		How many posts would you like to see now?
			text me a number please

	- user says "2"

	- bot says:
		Here is the third post listed in the hot category on the UCI subreddit:
		etc etc...

		* bot returns to line 36 *
